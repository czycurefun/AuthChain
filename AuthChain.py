        Answer: [Answer]

        Check the [Passage] for Completeness:

        1. Evidence Nodes Coverage
        
        a) Does each sentence in [Passage] contain at least one [Nodes]?
        
        b) Does the [Passage] explicitly include all items listed under [Nodes]?
        
        c) Are there any cases where the keywords in [Passage] are replaced by pronouns or vague synonyms (e.g., “it,” “they,” or “this” instead of the actual [Nodes])?
        
        
        2. Evidence Relations Coverage (Skip if [Relations] is empty)
        
        a) Does the [Passage] clearly establish or infer all of the provided [Relations]?
        
        b) Are there any unclear or weakly supported relations in [Passage]?
        
        3. Intent Entailment
        
        a) Can the specified [Intent] be found in or reasonably inferred from the [Passage]?

        Output Rules:
        
        1) If all criteria are met (i.e., the Passage covers all [Nodes], [Relations] if present, and [Intent]), output only: Yes
        
        2) If any criterion is not met:
        
            Provide a set of revision suggestions for the [Passage]. 
            
            Specifically:
            
                a) Indicate how to add or replace missing keywords (or remove ambiguous pronouns) in each sentence to maximize the number of keywords.
                
                b) Tell how to Revise or remove sentences that lack keywords until each sentence contains at least one keyword. 
                
                c) Explain how to clarify or insert any undefined or weak relations (if [Relations] are given).
                
                d) Show how to incorporate the Intent more explicitly if it is missing or unclear.
                
                e) Ensure any modifications still align with the original [Answer], to maintain correctness.

        Do not output any step-by-step explanations or chain-of-thought. Simply give "Yes" if all items are satisfied, or directly provide the revision suggestions if not.
